# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is my first step in pursuing a career in development. I created this as a reference to use throughout my bootcamp and as a means to expose myself to coding basics. In making this webpage, I worked through the git work flow, managing 'main' and 'feature' branches. I also began familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, and JS by writing code in these languages. Creating this webpage also exposed me to Chrome Developer Tools, particularly Console. You'll see notes for each of the topics mentioned above on the page, and you can view JavaScript functions in Chrome Dev Tools Console.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide contains a few notes on each of the topics covered in the prework section of my coding bootcamp. I have included a few bullet points for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
